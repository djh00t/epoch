# Systems Design Document for Epoch Application

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level architecture of the Epoch Flask application. It describes the main components and how they interact with each other.

## Application Structure
- The application is structured around the Flask framework, utilizing its capabilities for routing, request handling, and response generation.
- Flask extensions will be used to enhance functionality, such as Flask-Uploads for file handling.

## Modules
- **Web Framework Setup**: Responsible for initializing the Flask application and setting up the routing system.
- **Flask Extensions**: Handles the initialization and configuration of Flask extensions such as Flask-Uploads for file handling.
- **File Upload System**: Handles the uploading, storage, and management of image files.
- **Image Processing**: Processes images for metadata extraction, subject identification, and adjustments.
- **User Feedback**: Manages user interactions for verifying and correcting subject identification and image adjustments.
- **Video Creation**: Compiles images into a timelapse video based on user-defined criteria.

## Technology Stack
- Flask for the web framework.
- Flask-Uploads for handling file uploads.
- Flask-Uploads for handling file uploads.
- Python libraries such as OpenCV for image processing.
- Docker for containerization and deployment.

## Scalability and Integration
- The application is designed with a microservices architecture in mind, allowing for scalability and ease of integration with other services, such as a potential future mobile app.

## Security
- Security measures will be implemented at all levels, especially concerning file uploads and data processing.

## Conclusion
This systems design document will be updated as the project evolves. It serves as a guide for the development team to understand the application's architecture and module responsibilities.
