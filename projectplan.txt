Comprehensive Project Plan

Phase 1: Web Framework Setup
1. Flask Application Initialization
   - Set up a basic Flask application structure.
   - Configure essential Flask extensions (Flask-Uploads for file handling, etc.).

2. File Upload System
   - Implement a file upload interface to handle multiple files up to 50MB each.
   - Ensure multithreading support for efficient handling of large-scale uploads.

3. File Storage and Management
   - Develop a system for securely storing and managing the uploaded images.
   - Organize files in a structured manner for easy retrieval and processing.

Phase 2: Image Processing and Metadata Extraction
1. Metadata Extraction
   - Extract metadata (like date) from the uploaded images.
   - Sort and group images based on extracted metadata.

2. Image Preprocessing
   - Implement preprocessing steps (resizing, format standardization) as needed for consistent processing.

Phase 3: Subject Identification
1. Initial Subject Identification
   - Develop an algorithm to identify potential subjects in each image.
   - Implement machine learning or computer vision techniques as required.

2. Integration with Web Interface
   - Display identified subjects through the Flask app.
   - Allow users to verify, choose, or modify the identified subjects.

Phase 4: User Feedback and Image Adjustment
1. User Feedback Handling
   - Implement a feedback loop in the Flask app for user input on subject identification.
   - Adjust the identification process based on user feedback.

2. Cropping and Zooming
   - Implement functionality to crop and zoom images based on the confirmed subject.

Phase 5: Report Generation and Video Creation
1. Report Generation
   - Generate a report showing each date, summary of photos, and the chosen image.
   - Integrate report generation in the Flask app.

2. Timelapse Video Generation
   - Create a timelapse video from the selected and adjusted images.
   - Ensure the video is at least 10 seconds long and adheres to the specified frame rate criteria.

Phase 6: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment
1. Testing
   - Conduct thorough testing of each component, especially the file upload and user feedback system.
   - Test the overall workflow from file upload to video generation.

2. Refinement Based on Feedback
   - Refine the application based on testing outcomes and potential user feedback.

3. Deployment Preparation
   - Containerize the Flask app using Docker.
   - Prepare for deployment on a suitable platform.

Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization
1. Documentation
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the project.
   - Include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and system requirements.

2. Finalization
   - Final checks and validation before release.
   - Launch the application for use.
