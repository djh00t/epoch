Comprehensive Project Plan

Phase 1: Web Framework Setup
1. Flask Application Initialization
   - Set up a robust Flask application structure with a focus on modularity and reusability.
   - Configure essential Flask extensions (Flask-Uploads for file handling, etc.).
   - Ensure the application structure supports multithreaded operations and large file handling.
   - Establish a systems design document outlining module interactions and technology stack.

2. File Upload System
   - Implement a file upload interface to handle multiple files, with support for large files and zip/gzip file upload/unpack.
   - Ensure multithreading support for efficient handling of large-scale uploads.
   - Implement security measures to sanitize and validate uploaded files to prevent malicious uploads.

3. File Storage and Management
   - Develop a system for securely storing and managing the uploaded images.
   - Organize files in a structured manner for easy retrieval and processing.
   - Implement a database or structured file system for efficient metadata storage and retrieval.

Phase 2: Image Processing and Metadata Extraction
1. Metadata Extraction
   - Extract and parse metadata (EXIF data, including date and time) from the uploaded images.
   - Sort and group images based on extracted metadata.
   - Design the metadata extraction module to be reusable and easily integrated with other system components.

2. Image Preprocessing
   - Implement preprocessing steps (resizing, format standardization) as needed for consistent processing.
   - Ensure preprocessing maintains image quality and adheres to the requirements for timelapse video creation.

Phase 3: Subject Identification
1. Initial Subject Identification
   - Utilize computer vision techniques or machine learning models to identify and highlight subjects within each image.
   - Implement machine learning or computer vision techniques as required.
   - Ensure the subject identification module is designed for easy integration with user feedback systems.

2. Integration with Web Interface
   - Display identified subjects through the Flask app.
   - Allow users to verify, choose, or modify the identified subjects.
   - Create a user interface that allows rapid navigation and verification of subject identification in a low-resolution format.
   - Implement a feedback loop that captures user corrections and integrates them into the subject identification process.

Phase 4: User Feedback and Image Adjustment
1. User Feedback Handling
   - Develop a comprehensive feedback interface for user input on subject identification and image adjustments.
   - Adjust the identification process based on user feedback.
   - Integrate user feedback directly into the machine learning or computer vision models to improve accuracy.

2. Cropping and Zooming
   - Develop algorithms for cropping, zooming, and optionally removing the background to focus on the subject.
   - Ensure algorithms maintain consistency in subject size, perspective, and proportion across all images.

Phase 5: Report Generation and Video Creation
1. Report Generation
   - Generate a report showing each date, summary of photos, and the chosen image.
   - Include metadata and user feedback in the report to provide insights into the selection process.
   - Integrate report generation in the Flask app.

2. Timelapse Video Generation
   - Compile adjusted images into a high-quality timelapse video, adhering to user-defined criteria for frame rate and duration.
   - Ensure the video is at least 10 seconds long and adheres to the specified frame rate criteria.
   - Provide video resolution options (720p, 1080p, 4K) and intelligently upscale/downscale images as needed.

Phase 6: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment
1. Testing
   - Conduct thorough testing of each component, especially the file upload and user feedback system.
   - Test the overall workflow from file upload to video generation.
   - Achieve 100% pytest coverage for all modules, ensuring robustness and reliability.

2. Refinement Based on Feedback
   - Refine the application based on testing outcomes and potential user feedback.
   - Implement continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline testing and deployment.

3. Deployment Preparation
   - Containerize each module of the Flask app using Docker, adhering to microservices architecture principles.
   - Prepare for deployment on a suitable platform.
   - Ensure all containers are secure and comply with best practices for production environments.

Phase 7: Documentation and Finalization
1. Documentation
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the project using Google docstrings and README.md files.
   - Include setup instructions, usage guidelines, and system requirements.
   - Document the API references and ensure all modules are well-documented as if they are standalone libraries.

2. Finalization
   - Final checks and validation before release.
   - Launch the application for use.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the application against real-world scenarios.
   - Ensure the application is scalable and ready for potential future mobile app integration.
